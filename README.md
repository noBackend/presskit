What is noBackend
-----------------

noBackend is new approach to build data-driven apps without thinking backend.
It enables frontend developers to do common backend tasks by themselves,
like user authentication, sending emails, or payments.

There are several products and services that providucts that go in this direction,
some we are aware of are

* [deployd](http://deployd.com/)
* [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/)
* [Hoodie](http://hood.ie/)
* [Kinvey](http://www.kinvey.com/)
* [Parse](https://parse.com/)
* [remoteStorage](http://remotestorage.io/)


The goal of noBackend
---------------------

noBackend aims to empower as many people as possible to create real apps by following
the new approach. We do it by promoting the perspective of frontend developers with
something we call "dreamcode". With "dreamcode", any frontend developer can express
how he'd like to be able to accomplish a common backend task it a way that he's comfortible
with.

For example, to send an email, a noBackend solution could provide a method that looks like
this:

```js
sendEmail({
  to: "joe@example.com",
  from: "jane@example.com",
  subject: "Meeting tomorrow",
  text: "Hey Joe,\n\nwhen are we going to meet tomorrow?\n\nâ€“ Jane"
}).then( function() {
  alert("Email has been sent")
})
```
